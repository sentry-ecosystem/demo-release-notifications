# Title

Every time you push to this repo, it will create a release for the Sentry project `demo-release-notification`.
The CI will create a release.

The `sentry-test` org has been added to the flaggr rule.

This required adding the Slack integration for the Slack `Sentry` org to the Sentry.io `sentry-test` org.
